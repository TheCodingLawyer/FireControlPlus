## Configuration

### Default Config (`plugins/FireControl/config.yml`)

```yaml
# Fire Spread Control Settings
fire-spread:
  # Set to true to disable fire spread, false to allow normal fire spread
  disabled: true
  
  # Show messages when fire spread is blocked
  show-messages: true
  
  # Customizable message when fire spread is blocked
  # Use & for color codes (e.g., &c for red, &a for green)
  block-message: "&cFire spread is disabled on this server"

# Logging Configuration
logging:
  # Log fire spread blocks to console (useful for debugging)
  log-blocks: false
```

### Color Codes

Use these codes in your messages:
- &c - Red
- &a - Green
- &e - Yellow
- &b - Aqua
- &d - Light Purple
- &f - White
- &0-9 - Other colors
- &l - Bold

## Permissions

### Permission Nodes

| Permission | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `firecontrol.admin` | Access to all FireControl commands | `op` |

To grant permission to a player:

```bash
/op playername
```

Or use a permission plugin like LuckPerms:

```bash
/lp user playername permission set firecontrol.admin true
```

---

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Gradle (comes with gradlew)
- Java 11+

### Build Instructions

```bash
Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TheCodingLawyer/FireControlPlus.git
cd FireControlPlus

Build the plugin
./gradlew build

Output JAR will be in: build/libs/FireControl-*.jar
```

---

## How It Works

FireControl intercepts the `BlockSpreadEvent` from Bukkit and cancels fire spread events when disabled. This approach:

- Has zero impact on server performance
- Works seamlessly across all Spigot-compatible servers
- Can be toggled on/off without restart
- Preserves all other fire behavior (fire placement, damage, etc.)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Fire spread isn't being disabled

1. Check `/firecontrol status` to confirm it's disabled
2. Verify your config file at `plugins/FireControl/config.yml`
3. Ensure `fire-spread.disabled: true` is set
4. Reload with `/firecontrol reload`
5. Check console for any error messages

### Plugin won't load

1. Ensure you're using Java 11 or higher
2. Check that your server version is 1.18 or higher
3. Look for errors in the console on startup
4. Try deleting the config and letting it regenerate

### Configuration not applying

1. Use `/firecontrol reload` to hot-reload
2. Or restart the server: `/stop`
